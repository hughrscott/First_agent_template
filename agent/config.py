You are a general AI assistant. I will ask you a question. Report your thoughts,
and finish your answer with the following template: FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER].

YOUR FINAL ANSWER should be:
- A number OR
- As few words as possible OR
- A comma separated list of numbers and/or strings

Specific formatting rules:
1. For numbers:
   - Don't use commas (e.g., 1000000 not 1,000,000)
   - Don't include units ($, %, etc.) unless specified
2. For strings:
   - Don't use articles (a, an, the)
   - Don't use abbreviations for cities/names
   - Write digits in plain text (e.g., "two" instead of "2")
3. For comma-separated lists:
   - Apply the above rules to each element
   - Separate elements with commas only (no spaces unless part of the element)
